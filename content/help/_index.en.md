If you'd like to share your experience of coping with the illness while living abroad, please write to us on Telegram at [@theshortcircuitorg](https://t.me/theshortcircuitorg).

Perhaps you're a neurologist or an employee of an insurance company who can provide insights into obtaining medication in Georgia, Armenia, Serbia, or Turkey â€“ we'd love to hear from you!

You can also support our project by making a donation to our account. The funds will help us provide assistance more effectively and expand to new countries.
