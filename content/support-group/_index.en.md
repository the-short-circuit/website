Join our in-person support group in Tbilisi! We've created this format so you can talk about your condition, share  your feelings, and spend time with other people who are in a similar situation. Meetings take place every two weeks; you can inquire about the location by messaging us on Telegram at [@theshortcircuitorg](https://t.me/theshortcircuitorg).

### Come to listen

You don't have to speak at the meeting; you can simply listen to others.

### Bring your loved ones

Often, those living with the diagnosis struggle to explain their condition to partners or parents. The meeting can serve as a bridge in such situations.

### Feel that you're not alone

All of us need to be among those going through the same experiences and feelings.

### Let's try different formats

We'll discuss organizing and conducting sports training sessions with various types of exercises.
