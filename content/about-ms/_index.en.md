Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Today, this disease can be treated, and effectively managed, allowing individuals to maintain an active life and productivity for a long time. Early diagnosis, as well as consistent medication, is important, as this can help minimize disease progression.

Worldwide, about 2â€“2.5 million people suffer from this condition, with an average of about 60 individuals per 100,000 population. For example, the total number of patients with this disease in Russia is approximately 200,000, with the majority being young people aged 20 to 40 years. According to the WHO, MS ranks third among central nervous system disorders after vascular diseases and epilepsy.

While other things often take precedence in emigration, it is crucial not to interrupt treatment under any circumstances, as this can lead to exacerbations and worsen the prognosis.
